BrainVitaWPF
============

A .NET 3.5 project using C# &amp; WPF  to make a GUI for BrainVita. See http://thesundayprogrammer.wordpress.com/BrainVita for a brief description of the game. The project used F# originally for the model and then I tried to port to C# except I retained Tuple for F#. The Visual State Manager was first introduced as a toolkit in .NET 3.5. Hence both dlls have been included.
