BrainVitaWPF
============

A .NET project using C# &amp; WPF  to make a GUI for BrainVita. See http://thesundayprogrammer.wordpress.com/BrainVita for a brief description of the game.  The .NET 3.5 has been branched off as 'Net3.5'

Revision History
The current version is built using VS2015; .NET 4.5. There is no need for WPFToolKit or FSharp.Core and hence have been removed.


NET 3.5
Originally the project used F# for the model and then I tried to port to C# except I retained Tuple for F#. The Visual State Manager was first introduced as a toolkit in .NET 3.5. Hence both dlls have been included.
